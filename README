Usually multiple CMakeLists files would be used, with one for each directory. To keep things simple, only one CMakeLists file is included in the base directory.

The directory structure is as follows:
    src: all the source files for the project but no files with the "main" function
    main: includes a file with the function "main" to be made into an executable
    test: includes one or more files with the function "main" to be made into tests

To build this example, do the following from the directory containing the CMakeLists file:
   mkdir build;
   cd build;
   cmake ..;
   make install;

To run the tests, stay in the "build" directory and run:
   ctest;

The executables and libraries will be installed into the "bin" directory. This lets you build test code multiple times but keep a working copy in the "bin" directory.
